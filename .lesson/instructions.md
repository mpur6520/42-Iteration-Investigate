## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:

- iteration begins with 'while'
- the while line has a condition
- the while line has a colon at the end 
- **all** the code you want to repeat is indented after the while.
- any code that should run once the loop has finished is **not indented**
